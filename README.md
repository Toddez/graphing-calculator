![Activation Functions](docs/images/example.png)

## Installation

`yarn install`  
Install node modules

## Running

`yarn start`  
Run in development mode

`yarn build`  
Build for production

## Features

- ### Expression parsing:
  - Support for latex using [mathquill](http://mathquill.com/)
  - Parse which variables the expression defines and depend on
  - Check if expression is valid
    - Gives each valid expression a distinct color
    - Weight each expression and sort the order in which they need to be evaluated to solve and dependency
- ### Expression evaluation:
  - Send expressions to a web worker
  - Expressions are evaluated using [mathjs](https://mathjs.org/)
  - Results are cached
- ### Displaying Results:
  - Results are converted to screen space and rendered using canvas
  - Move around by holding left click and dragging mouse
  - Zoom using scroll wheel

## Plans

- Dynamic resolution based on graph complexity
- Find discontinuities
  - Previous version had this but it ran too slow to use in real time
- Floating precision
  - Change datatypes to something with more precision
- Saving/loading/sharing graphs
